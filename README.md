This is our semester long project for a location-based bulletin board realized in AR and some client server communciation models.

For simplicity of collaboration and security purposes, I have updated my TAMU Github account to a trivial one, so that you could all use my 
database authentication file in CommonMethods.php (I trust that you won't drop my database ...)

The codes are hosted on a HTTPS site so we have steered away from the non-secure projects.cse.tamu.edu.

It is hosted at h-tian.github.io
